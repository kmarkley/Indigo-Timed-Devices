# Timed Devices
This plugin creates Indigo devices that are essentially timers with built-in triggers.  The goal is to make some common tasks in Indigo simpler to setup, easier to maintain, and requiring fewer Indigo entities.

This plugin doesn't do anything that can't be accomplished in Indigo with a combination of Triggers, Variables, and Timers and/or Delayed Actions.  However, I find it very helpful in accomplishing those things quickly and simply.  I have seen a number of new users on the forums struggle with these sorts of tasks, and hope this may be useful to them as well.

This plugin requires Indigo 2002.1 and above.
